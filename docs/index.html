 <p> The yearly MULTI workshop is the premier event for researchers and practitioners working on multilevel modelling and multilevel software development.</p>

<p>Together with the Models Conference, MULTI 2021 will be fully virtual and will accommodate remote participation and presentation. All accepted papers presented online will be published by IEEE.</p>

    <p>Multilevel language architectures represent a new object-oriented paradigm both for conceptual modelling and software engineering. 
   In contrast to conventional approaches, they allow for an arbitrary number of classification levels and introduce other concepts that foster reuse and adaptability. 
   While multilevel languages and tools have reached a considerable maturity, the field still offers numerous challenges. 
   The MULTI workshop series is dedicated to bring together experts who develop and apply multilevel language technologies as well as those who focus on specific analysis and design methods or on economic aspects of this new paradigm.</p>
  
  <p>Multilevel modelling is an emerging new modelling paradigm that offers exciting new perspectives not only for conceptual modelling, but also for the development of software systems that are integrated with models of themselves. 
  Multilevel DSMLs allow for combining the benefits of economies of scale with the productivity enabled by concepts that were designed for very specific domains. 
  Multilevel modelling has been used successfully in a wide range of projects.</p>
  
  <p>The MULTI series is aimed at providing a platform for exchanging ideas and promoting the further development of multilevel languages, methods and tools. In particular, the goal is to encourage the community to delineate different approaches to multilevel modelling and define objective ways to evaluate their respective strengths and weaknesses.</p>
   </div>
  
  <div class="tab-pane fade" id="cfp">
    <p> Three kinds of papers are solicited: regular papers (10 pages), <a href="#challenge">challenge</a> papers (10 pages), and position papers (5 pages).</p>

  <p>Topics for regular and position papers include, but are not limited to:</p> 

  <ul>
    <li>the nature of elements in a multi-level hierarchy and how best to represent them,</li>
    <li> the importance and role of deep characterization mechanisms, including potency and its variants,</li>

  Authors submit their papers as PDF files via Easychair. 
  Challenge papers (see <a href="#challenge">below</a>) must  be  subtitled “A contribution to  the  MULTI Collaborative Comparison Challenge”.
  Accepted papers will be included in the joint workshop proceedings published by the IEEE. </p>

  <p>
  Multi-level modelling addresses the representation of subject domains dealing explicitly with multiple levels of instantiation, such as software development, process modelling, organizational roles, biological taxonomy, artifact types and so on.  
  In the last decades, many approaches for multi-level modelling have been proposed, with different purposes and founded on different concepts. 
  These approaches, have in common the goal of extending the traditional two-level approaches with constructs and concepts to deal with multiple levels of instantiation in a natural way, increasing the expressivity and reducing the complexity and ambiguity of models. </p>

  <p>
  Despite the advances in multi-level modelling approaches and tools, there is still no consensus on what kinds of constructs and concepts provide the best support for multi-level modelling. 
  The differences between the approaches exist not only at the implementation level, but even at the level of theoretical foundations and principles. 
  Researchers tend to use even basic concepts such as specialization or instantiation in different ways, since multi-level behavior adds new perspectives to well-known modelling concepts.
  This lack of a common understanding on multi-level modelling principles makes it difficult to compare and interoperate models constructed using different approaches, and is an obstacle to the advancement of multi-level modelling.
  </p>

  <p>The intention of this <b>Collaborative Comparison Challenge</b> is to move towards homogenising multi-level modelling by encouraging researchers of the community to collaborate with each other.
  Previous challenges (<a href="https://www.wi-inf.uni-duisburg-essen.de/MULTI2018/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/MULTI2018-BicycleChallenge.pdf">Bicycle challenge</a>, <a href="https://www.wi-inf.uni-duisburg-essen.de/MULTI2019/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/MULTI_Process_Modeling_Challenge.pdf">Process challenge</a>) asked researchers to illustrate the mechanisms of their approaches by addressing a set of requirements in a given domain. 
  The challenges were essential first steps in comparing and evaluating the different concepts, but since they focused on a single technology and allowed individual interpretations of the domain, they had limited utility for supporting technology comparisons. 
  For this reason, the Collaborative Comparison Challenge uses a different design: the challenge comprises researchers working on different multi-level modelling approaches collaborate with each other and write a joint paper comparing the philosophy of the approaches based on a common domain example available <a href="challenge2021.pdf">here</a>. 
  Papers should discuss at least some basic concepts commonly found in multi-level modelling including, but not limited to, instantiation, abstraction levels, specialization, deep characterization, cross-level relationships and constraints, custom constraints on the structure or behavior, multi-level attributes and operations, relations (e.g. containment or association) between modelling entities. 
  The papers should focus on showcasing the differences and commonalities between the approaches' foundational concepts rather than between implementation details. 
  Researchers are also encouraged to formally define the foundational concepts underlying their approaches and identify open questions wherever possible. </p>
